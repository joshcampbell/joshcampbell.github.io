<h2 id="software-development-portfolio"><a class="header-link" href="#software-development-portfolio"></a>Software Development Portfolio</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been a professional software developer since 2008. Almost all the projects I&#39;ve actually finished were written for money, and they&#39;re locked away in different companies&#39; private repositories. I do have a few interesting things up on Github, though:</p>
<h3 id="wikispex-2011-"><a class="header-link" href="#wikispex-2011-"></a>Wikispex (2011)</h3>
<p>I wrote this basic Wikipedia analytics application to teach myself how to make single-page apps. It integrates Flot for drawing graphs, Backbone to provide a little structure, and Bootstrap to make styling effortless. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t really grasp the utility of event busses and unit tests at the time, so development stopped after the whole thing collapsed into callback soup. Code quality aside, it ended up as a nice little protoype and taught me a lot about JS and the MediaWiki API.</p>
<p>It&#39;s particularly fun to use it to find edit wars and vandalism.</p>

<h3 id="phalange-coffee-2013-"><a class="header-link" href="#phalange-coffee-2013-"></a>Phalange.coffee (2013)</h3>
<p>This is a self-contained in-place editing component that I wrote alongside <a href="https://github.com/robovirtuoso">Alex Williams</a> for use in admin interfaces at Acumen Brands. It totals about 60 lines of code and 60 lines of tests, and I think it serves as a decent example of how to write Backbone objects and unit-test your frontend code.</p>

<h3 id="-timeless-way-slides-2013-"><a class="header-link" href="#-timeless-way-slides-2013-"></a>&quot;Timeless Way&quot; Slides (2013)</h3>
<p>The design patterns movement in software development may be long past its peak, but I think the book that inspired it (&quot;The Timeless Way of Building&quot; by actual architect Christopher Alexander) is still worth reading for more general insights. This was basically a book report that I delivered to my coworkers in an attempt to get them to read it. The slides are <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html">Lessig Style</a> and not very interesting on their own, but the repo also includes my lecture notes.</p>

<h3 id="textvom-it-2015-"><a class="header-link" href="#textvom-it-2015-"></a>TextVom.it (2015)</h3>
<p>I collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/CoreyBobco">Corey Bobco</a> and other members of an Uncreative Writing group to build some tools for generating nonsense text using Markov chains, which we could then edit down into coherence, use as a jumping-off point for creative writing, or just appreciate as a new perspective on the source text(s).</p>
<p>You can interact with it using the command line, or through a web GUI backed by Flask.</p>
<p>If you want to have some fun with it, I recommend mashing up two incongrous texts that share some common words. (In my experience, the <a href="http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/">futurist manifestoes</a> will mash up well with practically anything.)</p>
<p><a href="http://textvom.it">http://textvom.it</a>, a globally accessible instance of the web GUI</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/joshcampbell/markov-text-server">markov-text-server</a>, a cleaner implementation with fewer features (but you can specify the length of the n-grams it records).</p>
<h3 id="josh-tries-to-explain-ansible-2015-"><a class="header-link" href="#josh-tries-to-explain-ansible-2015-"></a>Josh Tries to Explain Ansible (2015)</h3>
<p>My employer had me research different options for server configuration management and build a proof of concept. Ansible won out in the end because of the elegance of its YAML-based DSL for specifying server configurations, and their excellent decision to manage clients over standard SSH connections rather than running a special daemon. This is the presentation I gave to the team to explain the basic concepts involved.</p>
